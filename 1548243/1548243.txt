WorldStateCheckpoints gives you a way to take snapshots of your SP worlds!  MightyPork [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1208573-142-checkpoints-backup-mod-save-points/page__st__40#entry18463847"]indicated that he most likely won't be continuing to support[/url] his awesome mod, so I got his permission to update it.

This mod requires [url="http://files.minecraftforge.net"]Minecraft Forge[/url] as well as bspkrsCore (below).

Ok, that's all well and good... and I'd even say that maybe 1/10 times this is my fault.  In order for me to help you, however, I'll need some info that you most likely have.  Use pastebin.com (or a paste service of your choice) to provide your full log file.  If you are using ModLoader, the log file is /.minecraft/ModLoader.txt.  If you are using Forge, the log file is /.minecraft/ForgeModLoader-client-0.log (for client) or /.minecraft/ForgeModLoader-server-0.log (for server).  Some mods have a setting called allowDebugLogging which should be set to true before you post your log file.  [color=#ff0000][b]WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING A RESPONSE IS LOW.[/b][/color][/spoiler]

[spoiler='A Note on PMs']I generally do not respond to PMs sent regarding modpack permissions (read the end of this thread and/or read the license) or help/support for any mods (you should post your issue/question on the thread so that anyone that knows the answer can respond). If you recently sent me a PM for either of those reasons, that's why you didn't get an answer.[/spoiler]

[b][size=5]News:[/size][/b]
13-Apr-2013 - A new version of [b]bspkrsCore[/b] is out (6.1), but it didn't work with [b]WorldStateCheckpoints 1.7.2.r01[/b], so here's [b]1.7.2r02[/b]!

19-Jan-2014 - 1.7.2 update is out! Let me know of any issues you find!

[spoiler='Older News']17-Oct-2013 - [b]WorldStateCheckpoints Forge 1.6.4.r04[/b] is out and adds some new localizations.

08-Oct-2013 - [b]WorldStateCheckpoints Forge 1.6.4.r03[/b] is now released! This is the first version for Forge, so let me know if you find any issues.

Also: I need your help! I'm looking for more localizations for non-English languages: [url="https://github.com/bspkrs/WorldStateCheckpoints/tree/master/resources/assets/worldstatecheckpoints/lang."]https://github.com/b...eckpoints/lang.[/url] Any help is much appreciated!

03-Oct-2013 - 1.6.4.r02 is out and changes the keybindings slightly so that there is only one now.  F6 opens the checkpoints menu and ALT + F6 triggers a quick save.

20-Sep-2013 - 1.6.4.r01 is released!

21-Jul-2013 - 1.6.2.r03 is released! This build fixes some confusing chat messages and adds the wsc command for saving and loading. Type /wsc for usage.

18-Jul-2013 - 1.6.2.r02 is out to address the issue of potentially messing up your world by loading a checkpoint while a checkpoint is still being saved.

10-Jul-2013 - 1.6.2 update is out!

5-Jul-2013 - 1.6.1 update is released!

3-May-2013 - 1.5.2 release is available.

9-Apr-2013 - I have released a new version of bspkrsCore for 1.5.1 and 1.4.7 to address the update check timeouts issue.  This release also incorporates a number of other changes including a super secret feature [img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png[/img] (don't ask, I'm not telling).  You will notice that mod_bspkrsCore.cfg is no longer used; mod_bspkrsCore.bsprop.cfg is used instead.  This is due to features that I've been slowly working on that are partially being released early as part of this defect release.

8-Apr-2013 - I have gotten the file downloads setup on a new VPS, so the links should be working now.  I will update them again once DNS propagates.

7-Apr-2013 - Apparently my VPS is down, and so my download pages as well.  You can try [url="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20748481/MC/index.html"]here[/url] for now until DropBox arbitrarily decides to cut me off again.

23-Mar-2013 - The 1.5.1 update is released!

15-Mar-2013 - The 1.5 update is live on the download site!  Change log will follow tomorrow (I'm tired).

10-Mar-2013 - [b]WorldStateCheckpoints 1.4.6.r03[/b] is out!  This release brings better checkpoint saving performance on big worlds (hooray for threading!), a fix for the "leaking worlds" error reported by Forge, and a few other small tweaks.  This release required changes to [b]bspkrsCore[/b] as well, so be sure to update that too.

23-Feb-2013 - I was just notified that I've exceeded my DropBox bandwidth limit, so the download links have been updated.

20-Feb-2013 - bspkrsCore is now a required dependency (see download link below).  I have also added in an option to limit the number of auto-saves that will be maintained per world.  Once the limit is reached the oldest auto-save will be removed as new ones are added.

15-Jan-2013 - 1.4.6 version works with MC 1.4.7.

23-Dec-2012 - Updated for 1.4.6!

21-Nov-2012 - Updated for 1.4.5!

16-Nov-2012 - Fixed the null pointer exception when joining a multiplayer server.  New releases are out for 1.3.2, 1.4.2, and 1.4.4.

15-Nov-2012 - Fixed a defect in the overwrite checkpoint GUI class that was pointed out to me.  Cut new releases for 1.3.2, 1.4.2, and 1.4.4.

14-Nov-2012 - Just uploaded a 1.3.2 retro-release in case anyone is still on 1.3.2 and wanting to use this (doubtful).

13-Nov-2012 - [b]WorldStateCheckpoints 1.4.2.r03[/b] is out!  This is a major release that adds auto-saving functionality.

Also released version [b]1.4.4.r01[/b] for the official MC 1.4.4 release tomorrow!

04-Nov-2012 - Added videos by ChronoFury and Aschoff.

03-Nov-2012 - Added screenshots and a mod review video by ProveIt_.

02-Nov-2012 - First release as WorldStateCheckpoints!  Thanks MightyPork for releasing the code under a non-restrictive license!  You rock![/spoiler]

[size=5][b]Installation[/b][/size]:
[b]1.6.4.r03 and above:[/b]
Requires [url="http://files.minecraftforge.net"]Minecraft Forge[/url] and [url="http://bspk.rs/MC/bspkrsCore/index.html"]bspkrsCore[/url]. Do not extract.  Drop the downloaded .zip file into the mods folder in your .minecraft folder.
[b]1.6.4.r02 and below:[/b]
Requires [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/75440-"]Risugami's ModLoader[/url] or equivalent (such as [url="http://files.minecraftforge.net"]Forge[/url] or [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1149336-"]FML[/url]) and [url="http://bspk.rs/MC/bspkrsCore/index.html"]bspkrsCore[/url].  Do not extract.  Drop the downloaded zip file into the mods folder in your .minecraft folder.

[size=5][b]Notable differences from MightyPork's original mod[/b]:[/size]
- no base class edits (that means the in-game menu is unchanged, and no extra buttons on the game-over screen, but should make it compatible with just about every mod)
- requires ModLoader or equivalent
- open the WorldStateCheckpoints menu using [b]F6 [/b]by default (configurable from the controls screen... hard to see due to ModLoader bug where it shows up under the Done button)
- fixed issue when loading a checkpoint where newer chunks wouldn't be removed

[size=5][b]Known Issues[/b]:[/size]
- every once in a while in my testing I noticed if a lot of changes are made and then you load a checkpoint real quick right afterwards, sometimes the changes are not reverted.  I think this is because the chunks are still saving, but if you load the checkpoint again it will almost always fix it.
- if your actual world name (not the checkpoint name) has special characters in it (specifically "!", but maybe others), it can cause issues when saving/loading/deleting checkpoints.
- try not to end your checkpoint names with a period.  I will add code to disallow this in the next release, but for now just avoid using periods at the end of a checkpoint name.
- when you load a world and auto-save is turned on for that world, sometimes you'll see a few errors in your console.  This is the auto-save failing, most likely because it tries to force save the chunks and runs into a concurrent modification issue.  You can always just manually do a quick-save if that happens.

[size=5][b]Where are snapshots saved?[/b][/size]

[b].minecraft/saves/Your World[color=#ff8c00]/checkpoints[/color][color=#FF8C00]/[/color][color=#008000]YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS!Checkpoint name[/color][/b]

They don't use any special format, so if your world folder gets corrupted (or world folder deleted), you can place your backed up snapshots into "saves" folder in minecraft and use them as normal world.

[b]Thanks[/b]:
- MightyPork (for making an awesome mod and letting me continue it) Give him some love!
